# RESTy
# LAB 27 - React Testing and Deployment

**RESTy Phase 2:** Test and Deploy the RESTy API testing application

## Phase 2 Requirements

In phase 2, we will be building on our working foundation, creating a full test suite and deploying our application into the cloud so that it is consumable for public access.

The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I expect to be able to use the RESTy application from anywhere via a public web server
- As a user, I want to be assured the application will always operate to my expectations
